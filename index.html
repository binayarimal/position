       <p>
         I am an aspiring software developer on track to start internship on March 2023. 
         My technical knowledge consists of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java, C++, and more. Besides
         coding skills, I have also gained valuable soft skills from working as a server at resturaunt
          for several years. </p>
        <p>
         I had finished an 8 months coding bootcamp by the organization Thinkful. It was an intensive fastpaced program that 
         dealt fullstack web development. While I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge, I really wanted
         to solidify my foundations before I started any job. This led me to Year Up, a skill development program 
         that aims to train young individuals to be professionals in the tech world. 
        </p>
        <p> 
         In the near future, I hope to work as a software developer in a company that aims to make a postive 
         change. Once I am in a financialy stable position, I would love to teach the valuable lesson I've learned
         both professionally and personally to the up and coming youths of the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Something to know about me is that when I get passionate about something, I dive deep into that passion.
         Whether it be photography, music, movies, or programming; I like to appreciate my endeavors by understanding
         and savoring them as much as I can. I hope to continue my ever expanding array of hobbies and interests. </p>
